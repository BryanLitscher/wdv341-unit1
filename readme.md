#Assignment: Download Git Client & Create a Repository account
Download the Git client software for your laptop or desktop machine and install it.

Create a Git repository account on one of the Git enabled websites.  GitHub is the best known account and the one we recommend if you do not already have a Git repo. BitBucket is another common Git account host.

You will use this repository for the course.

Please research the options and features of this site.  Address the following questions:

1. Define the following Git related terms:
	* version control software
	* add
	* commit
	* push
	* pull
	* clone
1. Create a folder called wdv341. This will become your Git folder.
1. Create your online repository account.  Include a link to your account page once it is established.
1. Create a PHP file called testGit.php that displays your name. Use Git to move it to your repository.  
1. Pull a copy of that file from your repository down to your Git folder.  Make a change and push it back up to your repository.
